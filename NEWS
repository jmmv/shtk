Changes in version 1.7
======================

NOT YET RELEASED; STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT.

* Added the shtk_cli_debug function to log debug-level messages.

* Added the shtk_cli_log_level and shtk_cli_set_log_level functions to
  query and set the maximum log level.

* Fixed option parsing to detect missing arguments to options.

* Fixed pattern matching in shtk_list_filter so that it supports
  alternative branches.


Changes in version 1.6
======================

Released on 2014-11-17.

* Added the unittest module, a framework with which to implement
  robust test programs purely in shell.  This new module supports
  defining test programs as a collection of standalone test cases or
  test fixtures; supports assert-syle vs. expect-style checks; and
  provides advanced checks to simplify the implementation of tests
  cases for command-line utilities.  unittest-based test programs
  can be trivially plugged into the Kyua testing framework.

* Added manual pages for all public API functions.  See shtk(3) for
  an introduction and follow all linked pages for details.  All
  docstrings have been removed from the code in favor of the manual
  pages.

* Added the shtk_config_include function so that configuration files
  can source other files using relative (or absolute) paths.

* Removed 'set -e' calls from shtk and from any generated scripts.
  It is the user who should be enabling this feature if he chooses to
  because 'set -e' may have suprising and inconsistent behavior in
  large scripts (and shtk can be defined as large).


Changes in version 1.5
======================

Released on 2014-03-16.

* Added a version module with helper functions to check if shtk is a
  given version or matches some constraints.  Useful to dynamically
  determine which functions to call in a script, if their need is
  optional.

* Added timeout support to shtk_process_run.  The new '-t' option to
  this function takes the number of seconds before forcibly killing the
  subprocess.


Changes in version 1.4
======================

Released on 2013-12-30.

* Added support for a user-defined SHTK_MODULESPATH variable.  This
  colon-separated, user-tunable variable lists the directories that
  contain modules.

* Added a modulesdir variable to shtk.pc so that third-party packages
  can install shtk-compliant modules into the shared directory.  This
  variable is also exposed by the SHTK_CHECK macro of shtk.m4 as
  SHTK_MODULESDIR.

* Added a new bool module with a shtk_bool_check function to convert a
  string to a boolean.

* Added a new cleanup module to simplify the installation and automatic
  execution of termination handlers.

* Fixed the config module in Mac OS X 10.9 to respect default values
  of configuration variables.


Changes in version 1.3
======================

Released on 2013-07-28.

* Sources migrated to a GitHub project from the previous copy in
  the pkgsrc repository.  shtk is now a first-class package and includes
  a traditional build system based on automake and autoconf and also
  provides a pkg-config file and autoconf macros to ease the integration
  with other packages.


Changes in version 1.2
======================

Released on 2013-06-18.

* Properly propagate errors returned by cvs checkout and cvs update.
  Problem reported by Nathan Arthur in private mail.


Changes in version 1.1
======================

Released on 2013-03-08.

* Added the shtk_config_run_hook function to invoke a hook in the context
  of a configuration file.


Changes in version 1.0
======================

Released on 2012-08-15.

* This is the first release of the shtk package.  The sources were
  located in the pkgsrc repository and shtk was only available as a
  pkgsrc package.
