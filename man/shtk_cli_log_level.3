.Sh NAME
.Nm shtk_cli_log_level
.Nd Checks if the given logging level is visible
.Sh LIBRARY
shtk_import cli
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar level
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
function checks if the given logging level is currently being sent to stderr.
The possible values for
.Ar level
are, in order of severity:
.Sq error ,
.Sq warning ,
.Sq info
and
.Sq debug ,
and correspond to the various functions of the form
.Sq shtk_cli_\*(Ltlevel\*(Gt .
.Pp
For example: after setting the level to
.Sq warning ,
.Nm
would return true for both error-level and warning-level messages, and would
return false for both info-level and debug-level messages.
.Pp
It is important to note that error-level messages are always displayed.
.Pp
The current log level can be programmatically set with the
.Xr shtk_cli_set_log_level 3
function and the default level corresponds to
.Sq info .
