<h1>Shell Tookit (shtk)</h1>

<p class="fs-5">The Shell Toolkit, or shtk for short, is an <b>application
toolkit</b> for programmers writing POSIX-compliant shell scripts.</p>

<p class="fs-5">shtk provides a <b>collection of reusable modules</b> that work
on a wide variety of operating systems and shell interpreters.  These modules
are all ready to be used by calling the
provided <a href="shtk_import.3.html"><tt>shtk_import</tt> primitive</a> and
"compiling" the shell scripts into their final form using
the <a href="shtk.1.html"><tt>shtk(1)</tt> utility</a>.</p>

<p class="fs-5">shtk is purely written in the shell scripting language so there
are <b>no dependencies</b> to be installed.</p>

<p class="fs-5">shtk is <b>known to be compatible with at least bourne shell, bash, dash,
pdksh and zsh</b>, and continuous integration tests prove this to be the
case.</p>
